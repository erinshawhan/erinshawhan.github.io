                    <p class="p1">This C# program developed using the .NET framework runs a rock, paper, scissors game through the terminal where the user can play rock, paper, scissors against the computer. This game was created as my final project for one of my IT courses exploring programming paradigms. The program includes the ability to load game statistics from a .csv file and display the leader board to users. The program asks users to input their name and saves their scores, along with their name, to the csv file and updates the leader board statistics. This project showcases my ability to code in the C# language, use object oriented programming, read and save data to a file, and handle exceptions in a computer program.<br><br>This project was one of the first times I experimented with analyzing, displaying, and editing data from a csv file. I was able to learn valuable knowledge about user interaction and working with data through a computer program. If I were to complete a similar project today, I would work on adding a GUI (or Graphical User Interface). This would allow the user to communicate with the computer without having to use the terminal and make the program more user-friendly and visually appealing.</p>

                    <img class="media2" width="300" height="310" src="poster.png" alt="">
                    <p class="p2">This project features a poster and a series of social media posts intended to advertise a fictional event, a cookie baking competition to benefit a local charity. I completed this project as an assignment in my graphic design course. The poster and social media posts were both created using Adobe Illustrator. Both the poster and the sequence of posts utilize theories of visual design and marketing, including the use of concepts such as color theory, visual hierarchy, and typography. This project highlights my ability to use design software as well as my skill in graphic design and UI/UX design concepts.<br><br>Creating this project allowed me to gain useful experience with graphic design and, specifically, with creating content for a digital platform. All of the materials used were created by me through Adobe Illustrator. I was given a lot of freedom regarding design, layout, and color scheme for this project and I am proud with how it turned out as my first time creating something of this scale by scratch.</p>

                    <p class="p3">This animated video project was created using Adobe After Effects and uses various images edited with Adobe Photoshop. The video was made for an assignment I completed for one of my IT courses focused on digital media and design. This was the first time I had attempted animation, so the concept was quite new to me. The intent of the project was to create a short animated advertisement for a fictional game company to practice animation and digital branding. This project demonstrates my experience creating media for a digital platform with the goal of conveying a certain brand. Further, this project illustrates my abilities and experience in animation, video editing, and photo editing.<br><br>Working with animation for this project was a challenge for me, as I was completely new to the process and unfamiliar with the software. However, I enjoy learning new skills and it was a great learning opportunity for me. If I was to work on this project more, I would like to make the advertisement longer, add more animated content, and clean up the animation. Although there are things I would change, I am proud of this project and am glad that I was able to gain some hands-on experience with animation.</p>
