        Hello! My name is Erin Shawhan, and I am a college student at the 
        University of Missouri. I am a junior studying Information Technology 
        with a minor in Psychological Sciences. I am 21 years old and from 
        Kansas City, Missouri. However, I live in downtown Columbia during 
        the school year. Back home, I live with my mom, dad, brother, and our 
        family dog named Finn! Aside from academics, I am involved in a few 
        organizations here at Mizzou. I am the current Vice President of both 
        Develop[Her] and Upsilon Pi Epsilon! I am also a member of the Society 
        of Women Engineers. Outside of school, I enjoy crocheting and watching 
        movies. Some of my favorite movies are The Royal Tenenbaums, La La 
        Land, and Scott Pilgrim vs the World. I have some experience using 
        HTML and CSS from previous courses and have built simple websites 
        before. I look forward to practicing my web development skills 
        further!
