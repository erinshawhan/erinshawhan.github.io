                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>My name is <b>Erin Shawhan</b>, and I am a college student at the 
                        <em>University of Missouri - Columbia</em>. I am from Kansas City, Missouri and live 
                        in downtown Columbia during the school year. I am planning to 
                        graduate in May 2025 with a bachelor's degree in <em>Information 
                        Technology</em> and a minor in Psychological Sciences. I am pursuing 
                        a number of engineering certificates, including Cyber Security, 
                        Information Systems and Technology, Media Technology and Design, 
                        and Web and Mobile Applications Development.<br><br>I currently work as 
                        a Student Research Assistant at the Mizzou Motion Analysis Center. 
                        Aside from academics, I am involved in a few organizations here at 
                        Mizzou. I am the current Vice President of both Develop[Her] and 
                        Upsilon Pi Epsilon. I am also a member of the Society of Women 
                        Engineers. I am interested in working in software development and 
                        cybersecurity, but I am open to exploring many of the various fields 
                        of IT.<br><br>I became interested in IT because I love finding creative 
                        ways to solve problems and I believe technology has the ability to 
                        make a positive impact in the world. I am passionate about 
                        increasing equity and accessibility in tech and uplifting the 
                        voices of underrepresented communities in computing. In my personal 
                        life, some hobbies I enjoy are crocheting and playing with my dog, 
                        Finn!
