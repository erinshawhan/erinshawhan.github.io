            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p class="first">
                When I think about my future, I see myself doing work that brings some benefit to people. 
                I want to be able to create solutions to everyday problems and make people's lives easier. 
                I have always been passionate about helping those that are often neglected and underrepresented. 
                Specifically, I would like to work on increasing diversity and accessibility in the technology industry. 
                Technology is a huge part of a lot of our lives, so it is important that it fits the needs of all kinds of people. 
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                Throughout my time at college, I have taken a diverse range of classes that have helped shape my skill set and goals. 
                For my information technology major, I have been in courses covering programming, cybersecurity, media design, and web development. 
                In the information technology field, there are so many career paths possible. 
                As someone who loves to learn, I really appreciate the ability to explore many different topics. 
                Being able to learn about the different areas of IT has helped me realize what I am passionate about and what I want to do in the future. 
                I have acquired skills and knowledge that would make an asset in many industries. 
                On top of my IT studies, I am also pursuing a minor in psychological sciences. 
                I have always enjoyed learning about human psychology and I wanted to diversify my learning. 
                I think that the ability to understand people of different walks of life is important in any industry. 
                In the technology industry, every project is centered around a customer and a human problem. 
                Because of this, I believe that studying psychology can be very beneficial as an individual in technology.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                Aside from my academic journey, I have also gained useful experience throughout my employment history. 
                I have a lot of experience in customer service and team oriented work environments. 
                In my most recent job as a student research assistant, I primarily work alone or with one other person and complete a majority of my tasks on my own. 
                These differing environments have allowed me to be able to thrive both on a team and independently. 
                I have built strong skills such as teamwork, dependability, adaptability, and the ability to solve problems. 
                In all of my jobs, I was expected to be a good communicator and be able to assist diverse groups of people. 
                My work experiences have helped me develop crucial skills that I will be able to apply in my professional career. 
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                All of my academic and work experiences have helped shape me into the person I am now and have pushed me to continue pursuing my goals. 
                By fine tuning my skills and gaining valuable knowledge, I am able to get closer to the future that I want. 
                I have developed a range of both technical as well as soft skills that will help me have a wider perspective in my work. 
                I hope to solve problems from both a logistical standpoint and a more human-centered point of view. 
                My capabilities and education will allow me to reach my goal of making a positive impact on people's lives and I look forward to my future.
