                    Welcome to my personal portfolio website! I'm excited to showcase 
                    the skills and experiences I have gained throughout my academic and 
                    professional career.<br><br>This website offers a glimpse into my academic 
                    journey, professional endeavors, and extracurricular activities. As 
                    an information technology student wanting to go into the technology 
                    industry, I believe it is important to have a resource that 
                    highlights my experience and technical skills. From my coursework 
                    to real-world projects, I've cultivated a diverse skill set poised 
                    to contribute to the tech industry. Here, you can find information 
                    about me as well as take a look at some of the projects I have 
                    completed or am currently working on. Additionally, you can learn 
                    about my work experience and my involvement in student organizations 
                    at my university. I hope that through this website you are able to 
                    get a greater understanding of my capabilities and ambitions and 
                    discover why I would be a good fit for your company.<br><br>Thank you for 
                    visiting, and I look forward to potential future collaborations!
